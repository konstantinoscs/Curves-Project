# Polygonal Curves Project
A collection of libraries implementing Locallity Sensitive Hashing (LSH),
Clustering, and Applications of it.
Implemented as software development project for my final year in Informatics Department.
# Parts:
Part 1 is implementation of LSH framework and comparison with classical hashing for polygonal curves
#
Part 2 is clustering using various combinations of methods, K-medoids, PAM, LSH etc
#
Part 3 is applications of the above in proteins formations and roads of Athens with data taken from OpenStreetMap

All of the project was implemented in C++ following the C++11 standard in some core features
